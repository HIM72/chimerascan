We would like to thank James Taylor and the bx-python team for the 
efficient interval tree implementation.  The interval tree and 
cluster tree implementations are well written and fast and help to
build the foundation of chimerascan.

We would also like to thank Andreas Heger (andreas.heger) and the 
'pysam' team for there excellent package.  Pysam is used in almost
every stage of the chimerascan pipeline and facilitated rapid 
prototyping and development of the tool.  We appreciate their 
efforts to make samtools accessible to the python community.

We would like to thank Ben Langmead, Steven Salzberg, and members
of the Bowtie and Bowtie2 development team for this excellent 
alignment tool. The performance of Chimerascan depends heavily upon
the sensitivity/specificity of the underlying aligner. 

Christopher Maher wrote the original 'chimerascan' in Perl and was 
among the first to use a high-throughput sequencing approach to 
discover gene fusions in cancer. His Perl implementation was used 
as a basis for Chimerascan.

Finally, we would like to thank Arul Chinnaiyan and members of the
Chinnaiyan Lab for their support.
